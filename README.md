# Android-Authenticity-Prediction

## Problem Definition & Approach- 
   Android malware is the malicious program that may damage the application or an entire system. It can also corrupt the data or can leak the sensitive information of      the user. The main objective of this project is to classify an app as benign or malware based on the datasets we have. This is a type of binary classification            problem and can be solved using various different classification algorithms such as logistic regression, svm, knn, decison trees or other ensemble techniques.            For this problem, I have used Logistic Regression as the baseline model & later on used Random Forest, Gradient Boosting & XGB Classifier. For evaluation of              classification algorithms, metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score & AUC - ROC cruve have been used. Model explainability is done with the help of          SHAP values which determine the feature importance and how much and upto what extent certain feature is impacting the classification.
